# SpotifyDataAnalysis
  A Python-based web application using the Streamlit library that analyses data has Four section including which has 
1.Home_section: will display a welcome message, a bar chart showing the top 20 Spotify IDs, and a brief explanation of how to use the website. The bar chart will be customized with a specific color and layout using Plotly. The function will be contained in a Streamlit container, which will allow for easy organization of the website's content.
2.EDA_section: Performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the given dataset. It allows the user to select columns to show, view summary statistics of the dataset, plot correlation heatmap, pie chart, and scatter plot. The function first displays a title for the EDA section and a container for the dataset. The user can choose to show the summary statistics of the dataset, select columns to display, plot a correlation heatmap, display a pie chart, and a scatter plot. The scatter plot shows the relationship between two variables (Danceability and Energy) and color-coded by Popularity.
3.Trend analysis: Perform trend analysis on various variables such as popularity, genres, track duration, number of tracks by year, energy, valence, and tempo. Visualize the trends using appropriate plots such as bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and pie charts.
4.User Behaviour Analysis: provides a user interface for uploading a CSV file containing the user's streaming data. Once the data is uploaded, the application performs various analyses on the data, such as identifying the user's most played song, most loved genre, top artists, track counts, favorite genres, and most popular songs. The application also provides visualizations such as bar plots of the top 20 artists by popularity and top 20 genres by the number of tracks. Finally, the application displays the distribution of added by counts. This methodology allows for easy and efficient analysis of a user's music streaming behavior.
